# Nodejs-JWT-webpage
This is a project that uses JSON Web Token to keep the track of user login in a site. 
Most of the samples of authentication that I saw uses Postman to emulate the reaction of webpages.
But in this project, I would like to show how client side receives the JWT and sends it to server after authentication.
