# Nodejs-JWT-html
This is a project that uses JSON Web Token to keep the track of user login in a site.

The server side is a fork from this project:

https://github.com/narenaryan/node-jwt-integ

Also there is a good documentation of above project in following link:

https://medium.com/dev-bits/a-guide-for-adding-jwt-token-based-authentication-to-your-single-page-nodejs-applications-c403f7cf04f4


Most of the samples of authentication that I saw uses Postman or CURL to emulate the client side.
But in this project, I would like to show how client side receives the JWT and sends it to server after authentication.
Thus the focus of this project is how to use JWT in client side and add it to header of HTML files.
